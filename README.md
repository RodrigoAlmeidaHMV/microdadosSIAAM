This repository is part of a study in the health field. The study aims to analyse the the characteristics of dapagliflozin dispensing within Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
and its economic impact, comparing these findings with the projections made at the time of its incorporation and subsequent expansion of use, as well as geographic disparities in its implementation. 
We will use data from the Ambulatory Medication Information System of SUS (SIA-AM) of Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (DATASUS), 
analyzing three different periods based on the milestones of incorporation, expansion of use, and inclusion in the Clinical Practice Guideline,
assessing potential trends and seasonal variations in medication dispensing:
1.	Initial incorporation until the expansion: June 2020 to April 2023
2.	Recommendation for expanded use until inclusion in the CPTG for T2DM: May 2023 to April 2024
3.	Post-inclusion in the T2DM CPTG: May 2024 to December 2024.
